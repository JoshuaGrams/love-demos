# Small idea/algorithm demos for the LÖVE game engine.

The Maine Game Developers group was talking about having a bit
more structure to our meetings. I suggested doing some actual
coding and playing around with various algorithms. [LÖVE] seemed
like a good vehicle for that: it's small, cross-platform, and easy
to get started with.
